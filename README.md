# ArduinoSoundProject
The goal of this project is to record and obtain sound data using a board, then have an AI identify when anomalies were recorded. 
Here is a rundown of steps I used and goals I considered:
1. Code the instructions for the board in C++.
2. Put the board together and test it's functionality.
3. Use serial port to read data from board in python.
     - Run the board and collect/ view data.
     - Create and save CSV files with data and timestamps. 
     - Create and save graphs using Matplotlib (just for visual help).
4. Use Isolation Forest and logic functions to make observations about the data.
     - Use Isolation Forest to detect anomalies in data. Anomalies occur when the sound stays consistent for a while, or when there are sudden fluctuations. 
     - Analyze the data to find the loudest and quietist sound values of the most recent file, as well as a user specified date. All files from the specific date are analyzed and the extremes are returned.

# Board Diagram
A diagram of my board setup can be found under the file **'board diagram'** within this repository.
# Code
All of the code I used can be found in the file titled **code** within the repository, or through the hyperlinks in these descriptions.
1. I first wrote the code for the board in **ArduinoIDE 2.3.3**.
You will need a C++ editor/ interpretor for this. No imports are required. 
The code can be found here: [SoundSensor.ino](code/SoundSensor.ino)

2. Second I wrote the code for saving and using the data from the arduino. I did this using **Python 3.13 in VS Code**. Other python interpreters can be used. Here is a link to the full code: [ArduinoSoundReadings.py](code/ArduinoSoundReadings.py). You will need the following imports:
```
import serial 
import time 
import csv 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import threading 
import os 
```

3. Lastly I wrote code to make observations on the saved data, utilizing Isolation Forest. I wrote this code using **Python 3.13 in VS Code**. Same as step two, other python interpreters can be used. Here is a link to the full code: [ArduinoSound_IForest.py](code/ArduinoSound_IForest.py). You will need the following imports:
```
import os
import pandas as pd
import glob
import re
from datetime import datetime
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
```
