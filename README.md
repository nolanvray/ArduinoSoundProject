# ArduinoSoundProject
The goal of this project is to record and obtain sound data, then have an AI identify when extreme sounds (highs and lows) were recorded. 
Here is a more step by stp rundown:
1. Code instructions for the board.
2. Put board together and test instructions.
3. Use serial port to read data from board in python.
     - Run Arduino code through 
     - Create and save CSV files with data and timestamps. 
     - Create and save graphs using Matplotlib
4. Find AI model to use. Edit it to fit the projects' needs
     - Answer questions relating to max and min sounds
